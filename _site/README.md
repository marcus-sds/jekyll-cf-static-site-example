# Example Jekyll Site for Cloud Foundry

This example Jekyll site is used in my tutorial describing [how to deploy a static site on Cloud Foundry](https://downey.io/blog/how-to-deploy-static-site-cloud-foundry/).

You can view this site live here:
https://jekyll.cfapps.io/

This site includes a pre-built `_site` directory so a working Ruby environment with Jekyll is not required to deploy it. :full_moon_with_face:
